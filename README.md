# CS-210-Banking-App
Project 2 of my CS-210 course.

# Project Reflection

## Project Summary
This project was designed for Airgead Banking to be used as a banking app that performs as an investment calculator for it's user over a period of desired years.

## What Did I Do Well?
One area that I performed well was the creation of the main.cpp file that included the display screen that users will interact with by given prompts that calcualte their investments based on user input.

## Challenges 
While writing this program, I did struggle a bit to write the Banking.cpp file which contained the program implementation in particular, writing the class method implementation. To overcome this challenge, I used my coursework in Zybooks to guide me on how to correctly write the class implemenation to maintain a workable program.

## Transferable Skills
Within this project, I was able to develop problem-solving skills, debugging and object-oriented skills which are transferable to other course work.

## How Did I Make The Program Maintainable, Readable and Adaptable
I made the program maintainable, readabale and adaptable by separating my functions into three different files which included a h file, .cpp file and a main.cpp file. I also used simply variable names on differnt lines and included comments so others will be have a clear understanding of each function and variable does.
